well i just set up the project in kicad and started the shcematics. I am done with the power decoupling part on the MCU and also wired up the USB type C and connected it to the MCU.
  

## 11/8/2025 - complted the schematics  

i just wired the oscillator and these quartz crystals are interesting🤔 also added memory and IO and just like that our schematics are finished! :yay

got some errors in ERC and fixed them as well

## 11/9/2025 - Placed the PCB parts  

So changed a couple of parts in the schematics and assigned the footprints and placed the main components with 0.00 mm symmetry. Didin't placed the decoupling capacitots yet and some resistors as well.

## 11/10/2025 2 AM - Started Routing the PCB  

Started routing the PCB and i can say i did it pretty rough. I placed the capicitors and resistors little too close to the rp2040 which made everything tight and i also used alot of vias for this as well.

## 11/10/2025 4 PM - Completed the Routiong  

Completed the Routing, had to move the capacitors and some components here and there to make space for traces because i placed them to close to the MCU. Now it is almost done but there are alot of errors that i need to fix **😭**
